Admittedly， it had been placed under extreme conditions when it failed， but such forces are to be expected from time to time when the machine is running normally. The magnets have yet to be fixed， although physicists think they know how to do it. Other， smaller hitches have compounded the problem. The collider has been built in eight sections， each of which must be cooled to temperatures only just above absolute zero.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is because the magnets used to accelerate the particles to the high energies needed for particle physics rely on the phenomenon of superconductivity to work—and superconductivity， in turn， needs extremely low temperatures. Unfortunately， the first of the eight sections took far longer to chill than had been expected.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If， as the other seven sections are cooled， further problems emerge， the start date will have to be put back still further. It takes a month to cool each section， and a month to warm each one back up to normal temperatures again. If it took， say， a month to fix any problems identified as a section cooled， each cycle would postpone the start date by three months. To accelerate progress （as well as particles）， CERN's management decided last week to cancel an engineering run scheduled for November. Instead of beginning slowly with some safe-but-dull low-energy collisions， the machine's first run will accelerate its particles to high energies straight away.</p><p><br></p>\",\"pageIndex\":0}]}]}"}
