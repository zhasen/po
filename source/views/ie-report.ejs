                Rise of the DIY satellite: Company launches initiative allowing ANYONE to send a probe into space  -  but it'll cost you ￡12,000
                　　Space exploration is no longer the preserve of huge agencies who can spend up to ￡280 million on a single satellite launch.Now amateur engineers - working in bedrooms, basements and garages - have the chance to launch their probes into space for just ￡12,000.For the price of a car, anyone who can send a tiny 5cm cube satellite into orbit to take pictures of Earth and perform cosmic experiments.
                　　This has all been made possible by Glasgow-based start-up Alba Orbital who has recently begun creating and selling the building blocks for tiny satellites named ‘PocketQubes’.Founder Tom Walkinshaw told MailOnline that he was inspired to launch the company after being rejected for a job at local company, Clyde Space.‘My skillset at the time didn't meet what they needed so I had to essentially create a company if I wanted to be involved in the industry,’ he said.
